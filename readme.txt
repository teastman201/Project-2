Usage
When you load the application it will take you to the homescreen giving some information about the benefits of the site and what it will do. Then you will proceed to a sign up screen where you will input your information for your account. Once completed it will give you a confirmation that your account was created, and give you a link to the search function of the application. When you use the search function it will append results from the database into a table of all applicable possibilities to your search criteria. Once the desired professional is found you will be given a way to contact them. Once contacted you can save your appointment within the app. You will travel to the appointment.html and put in the required information to create an appointment reminder. All appointments will be appended into a table underneath with input field. When finished with the app you can logout and you will be brang back to the homescreen.
